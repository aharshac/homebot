# homebot

set up instructions

- There are two android projects in this repo, one is intended for controller phone and other for the robot itself
- import the project to android studio
- make a kandy project and add api key, api secret, two usernames and relevant passwords to MainActiviy.java of both android projects
- make a relevant firebase project and add two apps for user and robot, add the google-services.json to each of app modules

With these credentials added, the app should compile with no issues what so ever

Instructions for building up robot and VR combo (later...)
